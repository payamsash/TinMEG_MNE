Here are shown the codes for the sound presentation of various pulses (P70, P75, P80, P85, P90, P95) in either a 60 or 70 dB carrier BBN (C60, C70).
GO are Gap Only trials. 
B - represent the trials of increasing sound intensity; and A - the GO, and Gap and Pulse trials (Pulse of 90 dB), with different InterStimulus Intervals (ISI) of 0, 60, 120, 240 ms.
